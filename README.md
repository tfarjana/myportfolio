## 👋 About Me  

Hi there! I’m **Tanvin Farjana**, a cybersecurity professional with hands-on training in **threat detection, cloud security, and system hardening** through a 400+ hour technical fellowship.  

I bring a strong foundation in **Linux, Windows Server/Active Directory, networking, and AWS**, combined with a background in **customer service and operations** where I’m used to solving problems under pressure and handling sensitive information with care.  

In 2025, I earned **1st place in Bloomberg’s “Hack the Knowledge” CTF**, where my team identified web app vulnerabilities and applied secure coding practices under tight time constraints. I’m currently pursuing **CompTIA Network+** and **AWS Solutions Architect – Associate** to deepen my cloud security expertise and grow into roles such as **SOC Analyst** or **Cloud Security Engineer**.

## 📁 Project Summaries  

### 🧩 Sentiment Analysis Web Tool — Secure Web App Project  

- Developed and deployed a **secure journaling web app** using **Python, Flask, SQLite, and TextBlob** to analyze and visualize mood over time.  
- Hardened an **AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance** with UFW firewall rules, SSH key-only access, and least-privilege configurations to reduce attack surface.  
- Applied **secure coding practices** (input validation, CSRF protection, parameterized queries) and integrated **Chart.js** for real-time sentiment visualization and private data storage.

### ☁️ Static Website with Serverless Contact Form — AWS Cloud  

- Designed and deployed a **static website** on **Amazon S3** with a responsive HTML/CSS/JS frontend.  
- Built a **serverless contact form** using **AWS Lambda, SES, and API Gateway** (with CORS support), enabling real-time email delivery without traditional servers.  
- Configured **IAM roles** and automated parts of the infrastructure setup to enforce **least privilege**, verify SES identities, and streamline production-ready deployment.

### 🪟 Windows Server 2022 & Active Directory Lab  

- Deployed a **multi-server Windows domain environment** with Primary/Replica Domain Controllers, configuring **DHCP, DNS, and RAS** for IP and name resolution.  
- Automated creation of **70+ Active Directory user accounts** with **PowerShell + CSV**, improving speed and consistency of provisioning.  
- Joined Windows 10 clients to the domain and applied **Group Policy Objects (GPOs)** to enforce security baselines while troubleshooting replication and scripting issues in a VirtualBox lab.

### 🐧 Ubuntu Multi-Node Cluster Setup (VirtualBox)  

- Built a **secure 3-node Ubuntu server cluster** with NAT and internal networking on the **192.168.1.0/24** subnet, using Netplan for static IPs and hostname resolution.  
- Automated **passwordless SSH** between control and worker nodes and configured **UFW firewall rules** to restrict access to only required ports.  
- Used this lab to practice **network testing, remote administration**, and hardening techniques in a Linux environment.

### 🏁 Bloomberg Hackathon – Cybersecurity CTF (2025)  

- Secured **1st place** in Bloomberg’s 2025 cyber CTF by identifying and exploiting web application vulnerabilities, then applying **secure coding and remediation strategies**.  
- Solved real-time **HTML and web security challenges** in a fast-paced team environment, demonstrating strong debugging, problem-solving, and communication skills.
